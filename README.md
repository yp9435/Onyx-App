<h1>Have You Ever Felt Alone Even When Surrounded by People?</h1>

<p>The ominous feeling that you might not get any help even when you shout out... Insecure environments for women make it harder and harder to open up.</p>

<p>We present our solution to this problem, <code style="color:purple">ONYX</code>, where you can build your network with a girls-only community app. The app comes with a random match chat interface, allowing you to make new friends with ease. The voice message feature can be converted to a deep tone to sound like a male, repelling males (i.e., making your friend sound like a big brother).</p>
